function [] = setupEnv(ros_root)
% SETUPENV Set up Python environment for accessing ROS Python libraries
%   from Matlab. If the ROS_DISTRO environment variable exists, assume that
%   the environment is already correctly configured and do not modify the
%   Python path. Load the helper module once the environment is configured.
%
% Usage:
%   SETUPENV('') Search /opt/ros for ROS installations and add the Python
%     modules in those directories.
%
%   SETUPENV(path) Search the specified path for Python modules
